# Pebble.js
Pebble.js is a visual IDE designed to revolutionize how web applications are built by using nodes or "pebbles" as fundamental building blocks. Our goal is to offer an open-source, extensible, and flexible platform that allows developers to create web applications with a visual approach while avoiding the pitfalls of spaghetti code.

## Description
Pebble.js is an innovative visual IDE where you can construct web applications using a modular system of pebbles or nodes. Unlike other visual IDEs or no-code platforms, Pebble.js stands out due to its:

* Open Source: Fully open-source with an active community and contributions welcome.
* Extensibility: Easily extendable with custom plugins and modules.
* Export/Import: Ability to export projects to standard IDEs like VSCode and import projects back.
* Reverse Compatibility: Features a visual layer transpiler to JavaScript, ensuring smooth transitions between visual and code-based development.
* Flexibility: No rigid structure; adapt the platform to fit your specific needs.
* No Spaghetti Code: Maintains clean, manageable code by design.
  
## Project Goals
* Clone Capability: Build a complete Pebble.js clone within the Pebble.js environment itself.

* Export/Import Integration: Seamless export of Pebble.js projects to IDEs like VSCode and vice versa.

* Dynamic Widgets: Drag and drop elements like widgets will be powered by extensions rather than hard-coded implementations. Widgets will naturally emerge from the visual language's capabilities.

## Features
* Visual IDE: Drag-and-drop interface for building web applications.
* Node-Based Structure: Utilize pebbles (nodes) as the core building blocks.
* Extensible Widgets: Extendable through external plugins and modules.
* Code Integration: Export projects to IDEs like VSCode, and import them back into Pebble.js.

## Installation
Currently, Pebble.js is in prototype stage and does not have a formal installation process. Stay tuned for future updates as we continue to develop the core functionalities.

## Usage
As the project is still in its early stages, detailed usage instructions will be provided once the core features are fully implemented. For now, feel free to explore the repository and provide feedback or contribute!
